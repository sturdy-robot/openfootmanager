/**
 * Derives the scoreline calibration bands in `sim-bench` from real results.
 *
 * # Why this script exists
 *
 * The bands in `crates/sim-bench/src/targets.rs` were, until now, twenty-one
 * numbers with no recorded origin. Five of them describe nothing but the
 * scoreline — goals, clean sheets, both-teams-scored, home wins — and a
 * scoreline is the one football statistic that is available under a licence we
 * can actually use. So those five stop being recollection and become a
 * measurement, regenerable from a pinned upstream revision.
 *
 * # Source
 *
 * openfootball/football.json — CC0-1.0, public domain, "use as you please with
 * no restrictions whatsoever". Results only, no per-match statistics, which is
 * exactly the subset this script needs.
 *
 * # The band rule, fixed before the first number was computed
 *
 * Each league-season contributes ONE value per metric. The band is the
 * **10th to 90th percentile across those league-seasons**, rounded outward to
 * the precision the report renders at (whole percent, two decimals per game).
 *
 * So a band says: *a value outside this is outside the range where eight in ten
 * real top-flight league-seasons fell.* It is deliberately not a confidence
 * interval on the pooled mean — that would be ±0.03 on goals/game and would
 * assert the engine must reproduce one particular league, which is not the
 * claim. The engine invents its own leagues; it should land where real ones do.
 *
 * This rule is written down here, and was chosen before any output was seen,
 * because the tempting alternative is to pick the interval that the engine
 * happens to sit inside. A band fitted to the engine is not a target.
 *
 * # Determinism
 *
 * Running this twice against the same pinned commit must produce a
 * byte-identical artifact, so it records the upstream commit and its date
 * rather than the wall clock at the time it ran.
 *
 * # Usage
 *
 *   node scripts/calibrate-scorelines.mjs --repo <path-to-football.json-clone>
 *
 * Clone with:
 *   git clone https://github.com/openfootball/football.json.git
 *   git -C football.json checkout <PINNED_COMMIT>
